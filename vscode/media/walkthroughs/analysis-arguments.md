Analysis Arguments
==================

The mechanism we use to configure which rules apply to the project during analysis is the labelSelector.

There are two ways to configure the labelSelector:

1. Using the [Konveyor: Configure Analysis Sources and Targets](command:konveyor.configureSourcesTargets) from the command palette.
2. Using the [Konveyor: Configure Analysis Label Selector](command:konveyor.configureLabelSelector) from the command palette.
