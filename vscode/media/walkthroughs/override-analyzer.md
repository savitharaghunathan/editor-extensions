# Override Analyzer Binary

The Konveyor extension comes packaged with a default analyzer binary. However,
you may want to use a custom or updated version of the analyzer.

To override the default analyzer run the [Konveyor: Override Analyzer Binaries](command:konveyor.overrideAnalyzerBinaries) command.
