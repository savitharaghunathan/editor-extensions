Custom Rules
============

The Konveyor extension allows you to add custom rules to the analyzer. This is useful if you want to add your own rules to the analyzer.

To add a custom rule, run the [Konveyor: Configure Custom Rules](command:konveyor.configureCustomRules) command.

This will open a file dialog to select the file(s) to add as a custom rule(s).
